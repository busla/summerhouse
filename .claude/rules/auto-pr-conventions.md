## Commit Message Conventions

### Types (by frequency)
| Type | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| feat | 5 | New features |
| fix | 5 | Bug fixes |
| chore | 2 | Maintenance/housekeeping |

### Scopes Used
- `auth` - Authentication-related changes
- `infra` - Infrastructure/Terraform changes
- (no scope) - General changes without specific module

### Message Style
- Imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- No period at end of subject line
- Max ~50-72 chars for subject line
- Body separated by blank line (when present)
- Body explains "why" not just "what"

### Footer Patterns

## Branch Conventions

- Pattern: `{type}/{description}`
- Types observed: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`
- Style: kebab-case for description
- Examples:
  - `chore/remove-lambda-build-artifacts`
  - `chore/cleanup-lambda-build-artifacts`
  - Branch type matches commit type (e.g., `chore/` branch -> `chore:` commit)

## PR Conventions

### Title Format
- Follows commit message format: `{type}({scope}): {description}`
- Examples:
  - `chore(infra): remove Lambda build artifacts from version control`
  - `feat(auth): add AgentCore Identity OAuth2 passwordless authentication`
  - `feat: Add WAF protection for static website`

### Body Structure

PRs in this repository follow a consistent structure:

```markdown

### Required Sections
1. **Summary/What** - Brief description of changes
2. **Test Plan** - Checkbox list of testing items

### Optional Sections
- Why (motivation)
- Changes (detailed breakdown)
- Technical Details
- Notes
- Breaking Changes

## PR Size Patterns

| PR Type | Typical Size | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| chore | Small, focused | Remove build artifacts |
| feat | Medium to large | New auth system, WAF protection |
| fix | Small to medium | Bug fixes, corrections |

## Code Ownership

No CODEOWNERS file detected. Consider adding one as the project grows.

## Directory Patterns

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `backend/src/` | Python backend (Strands agent, FastAPI) |
| `frontend/src/` | Next.js frontend |
| `infrastructure/` | Terraform IaC |
| `infrastructure/modules/` | Reusable Terraform modules |
| `infrastructure/builds/` | Lambda build artifacts (gitignored) |
| `specs/` | Feature specifications |
| `.claude/` | Claude Code configuration |

## Observed Patterns

### Infrastructure Changes
- Scope: `infra`
- Often includes Terraform module updates
- Build artifacts should be gitignored, not committed

### Authentication Changes
- Scope: `auth`
- Detailed technical documentation in PR body
- Often includes breaking changes section

### General Features
- May omit scope for broad changes
- Include PR number in merge commits: `(#N)`
